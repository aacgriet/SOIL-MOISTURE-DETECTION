# SOIL-MOISTURE-DETECTION

The project ‘Soil Moisture Meter using Arduino’ uses arduino board, a 16×2 LCD module and soil moisture sensor in order to display the humidity (moisture) of soil.
This project is very useful for farmer, floriculture, researchers etc. in order to know the moisture of soil at different stage. The working principle and circuit description is very simple that anymore can understand who have little knowledge of arduino board. The project is basically an interfacing circuit between arduino board with LCD and sensor.
